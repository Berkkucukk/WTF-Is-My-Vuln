- It is sufficient to start the program without parameters
- Detects all devices on the network
- It starts collecting information about the devices it detects
- List open ports and running services on these devices
- The employee checks whether there are any weaknesses in these services 
and notifies the user

#### Please be patient. The scan takes between 5 and 20 minutes. This time 
varies depending on the number of devices connected to the network.
